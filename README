This program works as follows:

Begin by prompting the author to enter a list of up to 20 words of up to 15 letters each.
Stop when the user enters a period "." instead of a word, or if 20 words have been provided, whichever comes first.
Create a 15-by-15 board that is initially empty. Select the longest word given, and place it horizontally centered in the middle of the board.
For each of the remaining words in descending order of length, place them on the board in a way that intersects with exactly one identical letter already on the board. All letters of a word must be separated from other words by at least one blank space, except of course where it intersects with another word.
Continue until all words have been placed. However, if it is absolutely impossible to place the next word according to the above rules, then indicate that with an appropriate message, do not place any further words, and continue to the next step.
Display the solution to the puzzle, with all the words that have been placed.
Display the unsolved puzzle and generate the anagram clues.
